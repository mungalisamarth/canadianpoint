            <p>
              Talc is the softest naturally occurring mineral, composed primarily of magnesium silicate.
              Its plate like particle structure, chemical stability, and natural brightness make it valuable across industrial sectors.

            <p>
              Not all talc deposits are equal. Himalayan talc from the Bageshwar region is valued for strong brightness,
              uniform particle morphology, stable mineral chemistry, and consistent performance. For automotive plastics,
